🧩 Dataset Fracture

The dataset contains global earthquake records from 2001–2022, including features like magnitude, depth, latitude, longitude, and tsunami indicators. It helps compare tsunami-generating vs. non-tsunami earthquakes.


---

🎯 Objective

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and identify trends, patterns, and correlations among seismic factors influencing tsunami generation.


---

📊 Visual Analyses

Time-series plots showing earthquake occurrences and tsunami trends over 22 years.

Box plots, histograms, and heatmaps revealing differences in magnitude and depth.

2D scatter plots of latitude vs. longitude highlighting regions with high tsunami frequency.



---

🔍 Key Insights & Observations

Tsunami events are generally linked to higher magnitude and shallower-depth earthquakes.

Certain geographic zones show a dense clustering of tsunami incidents.

A clear upward trend in total earthquake reporting over time, with notable high-impact years.
